  faqs: [
    {
      q: 'How long does it take?',
      a: '48 hours from a confirmed order to a live draft, in most cases. Then 1–3 days for tweaks before final launch. Photoshoot add-on adds about a week to schedule and shoot.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Do I own the website?',
      a: 'Yes. You own all your content, photos, copy, and your domain. The underlying template / code is licensed for your use while you remain a customer. If you ever leave, your domain is yours to take to another provider.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
      a: 'Yes. Cancel any month, no minimum term, no exit fees. Your site comes down within 7 days of cancellation. Your domain transfers to you at-cost (a tenner or so depending on the registrar).',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why is there a monthly fee at all?',
      a: 'Hosting, SSL certificates, your domain renewal, ongoing updates, and real human support cost time and money to provide. £19/month keeps the lights on and keeps your site fresh — it works out to one extra haircut a month for a barber, or a single hour of an electrician\'s time.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if I don\'t have professional photos?',
      a: 'Most small businesses don\'t. We can use stock or your phone snaps for the launch, or you can add the £150 photo shoot for proper photography. The site looks great either way.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Do I get a custom design or a template?',
      a: 'Custom. We start from a polished design system — typography, layout, motion — but each site is styled to your brand: your colours, your logo, your photos, your tone. No two sites look the same.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can we meet in person?',
      a: 'Yes — we\'re based in Dartford. Happy to meet for a coffee anywhere within a reasonable drive. Most customers are perfectly served by message and email, but the option is there.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What about Google ranking and SEO?',
      a: 'Every site ships with the technical SEO basics done properly: title tags, meta descriptions, LocalBusiness schema for Google rich results, fast load times, mobile-first design, sitemap, and a clean URL structure. Ongoing SEO campaigns (link building, content marketing) are not included — that\'s a different service.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I update the site myself?',
      a: 'No — and that\'s deliberate. DIY editors create messy sites. Instead, you message us with what you want changed, and we typically update it within a couple of hours during business hours. That\'s what the £19/month covers.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if I want to add e-commerce later?',
      a: "Yes — when you're ready to sell online, we'll help you onboard onto Shopify (or whichever e-commerce platform fits best for your business). We bring your brand, content and domain across with you, so you keep all the trust and search ranking you've already built up.",
